Brown dwarf

The least massive known star in the universe is called a "brown dwarf." Brown dwarfs are objects that are too small to sustain hydrogen fusion in their cores,
which is the process that powers stars. As a result, they are not able to produce enough energy to shine as brightly as a star.
The least massive known brown dwarf has a mass of about 0.08 times the mass of the Sun. This is about 80 times the mass of Jupiter,
which is the largest planet in the Solar System. Brown dwarfs can be much smaller than this, with masses as low as about 13 times the mass of Jupiter, but these objects
are difficult to detect and are not well-studied.
It is possible that there may be even smaller objects in the universe that are too small to be classified as brown dwarfs, but these objects have not yet been detected.
